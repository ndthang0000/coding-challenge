# Project Overview

Welcome to the test home test project! This document provides an introduction to the interview challenge, the folder structure, and basic guidelines for contributing to the project.


The project is organized into the following folders:

```
/PAVE - root folder
├── /question-1
│   ├── /src
│   ├── package.json
│   └── README.md
├── /question-2
│   ├── /env
│   ├── /src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── README.md
└── README.md
```

You should view README.md in each ```question folder``` to setup and run it smoothly
